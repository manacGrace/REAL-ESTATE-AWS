## Project Description

This project was a personal challenge to rework a school assignment and make it **compatible with AWS EC2 instances**.

The original goal of the school project was to create a **real estate website** and demonstrate the ability to build a functional application by following the principles of a *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)*.  
The application was developed using **React** for the frontend, connected to a **SQL** database via a **Java** backend. It allows users to browse and view various pages and listed properties.
